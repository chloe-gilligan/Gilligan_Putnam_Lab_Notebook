##Equipment

- 2 Trifold Beakers

- 500 mL Gradulated Cylinder 

- 900 mL Distilled Water

- 100 mL Hydrochloric Acid

- Plastic Bin

- Spray Bottle of Alkaline Glassware Detergent



##Protocol

1)  Wear proper PPE (gloves, glasses, close-toed shoes, pants, and a lab coat)

2) Fill up a trifold beaker with 900 mL Distilled Water (DI water), using a 500 mL graduated cylinder to measure

3) Place the tripour beaker into a bin to prevent any spills

4) Gently place coral into the tripor beaker with 900 mL of DI water 

5) Using a 500 mL graduated cylinder, measure 100 mL of Hydrochloric Acid (HCl)

6) Pour the 100 mL of HCl into the 900 mL of DI water holding the coral. This will make a diluted solution of 10% HCl.

7) Always make sure the water is added first before the HCl

8) The coral should fizz or bubble

9) Leave the coral in the HCl solution to decalcify. This may be for several hours or days.

10) If not dissolving, carfully pour half of the 10% HCl solution holding the coral into a seperate tripour beaker 

11) Add another 50 mL of HCl into a 500 mL graduated cylinder and pour it into the tripour beaker holding the coral 


#Clean Up

1) Rinse the graduated cylinder and any other glassware with Alkaline Glassware Detergent at least 3 times

2) Then, rinse with distilled water before hanging to dry in designated drying area 

3) Dispose of any solid waste into a bag labelled for Hydrochloric acid solid waste.
