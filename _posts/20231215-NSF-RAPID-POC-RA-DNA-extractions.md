## DNA Extractions for Pocillopora Lagoon Relative Abundance NSF RAPID, December 13, 2023

### [Protocol Link](https://github.com/chloe-gilligan/Gilligan_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/protocols/20231208_zymo_DNA_miniprepplusKit_Protocol.md)

### Extraction of 16 samples for NSF RAPID COTS project. These Pocillopora samples were collected in Mo'orea in May 2022 and all samples were fixed in DNA/RNA shield.
Started with 18 samples but made an error with POC 414 and 415 so will redo those. 

## Samples

Samples inclue POC ID 414-430 and 430 BIS.
Samples were collected at different sites in the lagoon and on varying transects. All samples have 2 replicates. These samples were taken from a box in the bench freezer entitled, "Site S4 1".

## Notes

- Followed [protocol](https://github.com/chloe-gilligan/Gilligan_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/20231208_zymo_DNA_miniprepplusKit_Protocol.md) exactly except for changes below.
	- At the Proteinase K Digestion step I used 200 uL of supernatant + 200 uL of DNA/RNA shield from the sample tube to conserve some DNA.
	- At DNA Extraction step, I did two washes with 700 uL of gDNA _Wash_ Buffer

## Qubit Results

- Used Broad range dsDNA Qubit [Protocol](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/)
- All samples read twice, standard only read once

## DNA Quality Check: Gel, using [Kristina's gel protocol at the bottom of this page.](https://github.com/chloe-gilligan/Gilligan_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/20231208_zymo_DNA_miniprepplusKit_Protocol.md)

Added 9 uL aliquots of DNA sample to 1 uL of dye to the gel

Gel was re run on 20231220 which is the photo below.
