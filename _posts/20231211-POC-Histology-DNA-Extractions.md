## DNA Extractions for Pocillopora histology, December 11, 2023

### [Protocol Link](https://github.com/chloe-gilligan/Gilligan_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/protocols/20231208_zymo_DNA_miniprepplusKit_Protocol.md)

### Extraction of 4 samples for Pocillopora Histology project. These samples were collected in Mo'orea in April 2022 for Histology. All samples are fixed and samples were a replicate 2. Extractions were done on 20231207 and QC was done on 20231211

## Samples

These samples are part of the protocol development for DNA extractions for fixed samples and sample processing. There are 20 total samples that will be processed for Pocillopora histology analysis; 10 samples #466-475 from the lagoon and 10 samples #476-485 from the forereef. 4 of the fixed samples from the lagoon #467-470 were selected from the -4ºC walk-in cooler.

## Notes

- Followed [protocol](https://github.com/chloe-gilligan/Gilligan_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/20231208_zymo_DNA_miniprepplusKit_Protocol.md) exactly. At the Proteinase K Digestion stage I took 400 uL of supernatent from the sample tubes for all samples except for 468, which had a spill and 100 uL was then used and adjusted accordingly proceeding with the extraction as written.


## Qubit Results

- Used Broad range dsDNA Qubit [Protocol](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/)
- All samples read twice, standard only read once

DNA Standards: 202.31 (S1) & 18946.25 (S2)

## DNA Quality Check: Gel, using [Kristina's gel protocol at the bottom of this page.](https://github.com/chloe-gilligan/Gilligan_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/20231208_zymo_DNA_miniprepplusKit_Protocol.md)

## Next steps

Since there doesn't seem to be enough DNA to get any signal I will work on troubleshooting the protocol one step at a time until I get an adequet amount of DNA for sequencing. My first adjustment will be to increase incubation time from 20 minutes to 1 hour at 55ºC at the Proteinase K Digestion step. The rest of the protocol was followed as written.
