## DNA Extractions for Pocillopora TPC NSF RAPID, December 13, 2023

### [Protocol Link](https://github.com/chloe-gilligan/Gilligan_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/protocols/20231208_zymo_DNA_miniprepplusKit_Protocol.md)

### Extraction of 4 samples for NSF RAPID COTS project. These Pocillopora samples were collected in Mo'orea in May 2022 and all samples were fixed in DNA/RNA shield.

## Samples

Samples were collected at different sites in the lagoon and on varying transects. All samples have 2 replicates. These samples were taken from a box in the bench freezer entitled, "Site S4 1".

## Notes

- Followed [protocol](https://github.com/chloe-gilligan/Gilligan_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/20231208_zymo_DNA_miniprepplusKit_Protocol.md) exactly except for changes below.
	- At the Proteinase K Digestion step I used 200 uL of supernatant + 200 uL of DNA/RNA shield from the sample tube to conserve some DNA.
	- At DNA Extraction step, I did two washes with 700 uL of gDNA _Wash_ Buffer

## Qubit Results

- Used Broad range dsDNA Qubit [Protocol](https://zdellaert.github.io/ZD_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/Qubit-Protocol/)
- All samples read twice, standard only read once

DNA Standards: 191.17 (S1) & 19469.32 (S2)

| sample_id | DNA_QBIT_1 | DNA_QBIT_2 | 
|-----------|------------|------------|
| POC-410   | 3.98       |4.06        |
| POC-411   | 75.6       |77.0        |
| POC-412   | 45.4       |46.4        |
| POC-413   | 57.2       |57.6        |
 


## DNA Quality Check: Gel, using [Kristina's gel protocol at the bottom of this page.](https://github.com/chloe-gilligan/Gilligan_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/20231208_zymo_DNA_miniprepplusKit_Protocol.md)

## Next steps

- Going to try to run gel again with same samples for 2 hours at 60 V to see if that has a positive effect on the sample.
