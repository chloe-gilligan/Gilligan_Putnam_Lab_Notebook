## DNA Extractions for Pocillopora TPC NSF RAPID, December 13, 2023

### [Protocol Link](https://github.com/chloe-gilligan/Gilligan_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/protocols/20231208_zymo_DNA_miniprepplusKit_Protocol.md)

### Extraction of 18 samples for NSF RAPID COTS project. These Pocillopora samples were collected in Mo'orea and all samples were fixed in DNA/RNA shield.

## Samples

Samples were collected at different sites in the lagoon and on varying transects. All samples have 2 replicates. These samples were previously sequenced but needed to be resequenced

## Notes

- Followed [protocol](https://github.com/chloe-gilligan/Gilligan_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/20231208_zymo_DNA_miniprepplusKit_Protocol.md) exactly except for changes below.
	- At the Proteinase K Digestion step I used 200 uL of supernatant + 200 uL of DNA/RNA shield from the sample tube to conserve some DNA.
	- At DNA Extraction step, I did two washes with 700 uL of gDNA _Wash_ Buffer
	- There was not enough samples sometimes barely 50 uL so for everything I could get 100uL out of the 300 uL of DNA/RNA sheild was used. And for sample 386, 294, and 296 50 uL of samples was used and 350 uL of DNA/RNA shield. 

## Qubit Results

- Used Broad range dsDNA Qubit [Protocol](https://github.com/chloe-gilligan/Gilligan_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/protocols/20231214-dsDNA-Qubit-Quantification-Protocol.md)
- All samples read twice, standard only read once

DNA Standards: 200.41 (S1) & 17792.29 (S2)

## DNA Quality Check: Gel, using [Kristina's gel protocol at the bottom of this page.](https://github.com/chloe-gilligan/Gilligan_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/20231208_zymo_DNA_miniprepplusKit_Protocol.md)

Added 9 uL aliquots of DNA sample to 1 uL of dye to the gel.

## Next steps
- I will talk to Hollie and Pierrick about how to procede.
