## PCR for Pocillopora Lagoon Relative Abundance NSF RAPID, December 14, 2023

### [Protocol Link](https://github.com/chloe-gilligan/Gilligan_Putnam_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/protocols/20231215-PCR-Protocol.md)

### PCR for 4 samples for NSF RAPID COTS project. These Pocillopora samples were collected in Mo'orea in May 2022.

## Samples

Samples were collected at different sites in the lagoon and on varying transects. All samples have 2 replicates. These samples were taken from a box in the bench freezer entitled, "Site S4 1".
