#Analyzing Histology Slides#

- Open file from ImageJ
- Record Date, Sec, File name, Image Name, Scale, and units
- In tool bar select Analyze and then click set scale. Record the "distance in pixels" as the standard scale of measurements. This should be the same across files.
- Using the bean shaped line button, create an accurate trace of the total area of the polyp. Can be done in sections to ensure proper tracing. 
- Once circled, in tool bar select analyze then measure and add/ record measurement of total area
- Repeat same steps while only measuring areas covered by gamates
- Insert a grid over the image, size doesn't matter as it is for personal observation
- For abundance going through the grid once per stage, using a clicker record amount of each stage across file
- For my case, I only recorded eggs with nucleus to guarantee I did not recount across files display different sections of same polyp
- Repeat same steps for average abundance going through grid, however since all roughly same size in each stage only measure size of 10 and then record average per stage
