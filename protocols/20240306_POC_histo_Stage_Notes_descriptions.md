# Time of development

- Oocytes: started in October-Janurary, with little to none found in Feburary and March (Krueger, Schleyer 1998)

- Spermatotcytes: Growth from October-December
Some species in the red sea apear to start oogenesis up to 3 months before spermatogensis (Krueger, Schleyer 1998)

# Size


### Oocytes
The mean diameters (+-standard deviation) of the oocyte stages. The maximum size attained by the oocytes was 345 lm (Krueger, Schleyer 1998). 

Stage one: 8 +- 3 um (Krueger, Schleyer 1998)
oocytes 10 um to 50 um (Stoddart, Black 1985)

Stage two: 22 +- 8 um (Krueger, Schleyer 1998)
Oocyte <50 um, usually >30 pm diameter (Stoddart, Black 1985)

Stage three: 60 +- 22 um (Krueger, Schleyer 1998)
Oocytes from 50 to 70 um diameter (Stoddart, Black 1985)

Stage four: 149 +- 25 um (Krueger, Schleyer 1998)
Oocyte >70um diameter and up to 116um (Stoddart, Black 1985)


### Spermatocytes 

The mean diameters (standard deviation) of the spermaries
Stage one:  48 +- 42 um (Kruger, Schleyer 1998)
Spermaria usually <30 um diameter (Stoddart, Black 1985)

Stage two: 129 +- 50 um (Kruger, Schleyer 1998)
up to 200 um (Stoddart, Black 1985)

Stage three: 206 +- 73 um (Kruger, Schleyer 1998)
usually > 100pm diameter (Stoddart, Black 1985)

Stage four: 293 +- 57 um (Kruger, Schleyer 1998)

(Stoddart, Black 1985)

# Description of stages

 

### Oocytes

Pronounced nucleus for all stages of development 

- Stage One: No cytoplasam present (Kruger, Schleyer 1998)


- Stage Two: Uniform cytoplasam present (Kruger, Schleyer 1998)  Between stages there is a reduction  in oocytes per ovary (Stoddart, Black 1985)


- Stage Three: Undergoing vitellogenesis (formation of yolk) and contain small spherical cavities in the cytoplasm. These cavities contain lipid but lipid is no longer present after histological slide preperation (Kruger, Schleyer 1998)(Stoddart, Black 1985)


- Stage Four: Oocytes are mature; their cytoplasm was filled with enlarged vacuoles, and they are infested with zooxanthellae before spawning (Kruger, Schleyer 1998).

 - Membrane stained dark purple and nucleus is located on the outer edge of the oocyte 



### Spermatocytes

- Stage One: Cluster of spermatogonia is surrounded by a spermatoginal wall (Kruger, Schleyer 1998)

- Stage Two: The spermatocytes are evenly distributed throughout spermaries (Kruger, Schleyer 1998)

- Stage Three: Spermatocytes still evenly distributed but with smaller spermatids around the periphery/border of the spermaries (Kruger, Schleyer 1998)

- Stage Four: Spermaries had mature spermatozoa that were half the size of the spermatids and had visible tails (Kruger, Schleyer 1998)



Notes:
(Kruger, Schleyer 1998) Species studied is Pocillopora verrucosa
(Stoddart, Black 1985) Species studied is Pocillopora damicornis
