# Time of development

- Oocytes: started in October-Janurary, with little to none found in Feburary and March (Krueger, Schleyer 1998)

- Spermatotcytes: Growth from October-December
Some species in the red sea apear to start oogenesis up to 3 months before spermatogensis (Krueger, Schleyer 1998)

# Size


### Oocytes
The mean diameters (+-standard deviation) of the oocyte stages. The maximum size attained by the oocytes was 345 lm (Krueger, Schleyer 1998). 

Stage one: 8 +- 3 um (Krueger, Schleyer 1998)

Stage two: 22 +- 8 um (Krueger, Schleyer 1998)

Stage three: 60 +- 22 um (Krueger, Schleyer 1998)

Stage four: 149 +- 25 um (Krueger, Schleyer 1998)


### Spermatocytes 

The mean diameters (standard deviation) of the spermaries
Stage one:  48 +- 42 um (Kruger, Schleyer 1998)

Stage two: 129 +- 50 um (Kruger, Schleyer 1998)

Stage three: 206 +- 73 um (Kruger, Schleyer 1998)

Stage four: 293 +- 57 um (Kruger, Schleyer 1998)


# Description of stages

 

### Oocytes

Pronounced nucleus for all stages of development 

- Stage One: No cytoplasam present (Kruger, Schleyer 1998)


- Stage Two: Uniform cytoplasm present (Kruger, Schleyer 1998)  


- Stage Three: Undergoing vitellogenesis (formation of yolk) and contain small spherical cavities in the cytoplasm. These cavities contain lipid but lipid is no longer present after histological slide preparation (Kruger, Schleyer 1998)


- Stage Four: Oocytes are mature; their cytoplasm was filled with enlarged vacuoles, and they are infested with zooxanthellae before spawning (Kruger, Schleyer 1998).

 - Membrane stained dark purple and nucleus is located on the outer edge of the oocyte 



### Spermatocytes

- Stage One: Cluster of spermatogonia is surrounded by a spermatoginal wall (Kruger, Schleyer 1998)

- Stage Two: The spermatocytes are evenly distributed throughout spermaries (Kruger, Schleyer 1998)

- Stage Three: Spermatocytes still evenly distributed but with smaller spermatids around the periphery/border of the spermaries (Kruger, Schleyer 1998)

- Stage Four: Spermaries had mature spermatozoa that were half the size of the spermatids and had visible tails (Kruger, Schleyer 1998)



Notes:
(Kruger, Schleyer 1998) Species studied is Pocillopora verrucosa
