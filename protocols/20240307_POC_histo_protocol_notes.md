## Work flow
- Using unity to open files (insert Danielle's protocol for installing unity)
- Once imageJ is open, select file and then open a .vsi file
- Each sample has two slides with two cross sections on each slide,
- During creating of staging guide, opening the first cross section and then moving to second if no gametes observed
	- Series 14 was the first opened and was opened at the maximum capacity in order to also get microns
- For the stage guide, corals were sized and characteristics were observed in order to assign a stage.
- When taking measurements, the diagonal diameter of oocytes was taken as they were usually and elongated oval shape.
	- For the final staging and sizing, the method of size measurements will be taken as a geometric mean
- Grid of 11,000 was overlaid
- 5 polyps per corss sectioned were counted and sized
- Started on polyp on top left of grid and worked through the 5 polyps
- Counted all gametes in the cross section of 5 polyps
- 3 gametes were measured of each stage
	- If less then 3 gametes found of a stage, the amoutn seen would be measured
- The first slide was opened and the first series, if the slide does not look great, series 21 was opened, adn if that is not great I went to slide two and repeated the process. 


- Running into an issue where I am assigning stage to oocytes without a nucleus based on timing and size for relative abundance but then sizing it anyways. 
 	- What I will do is make a note of when they were sized without a nuclues if it was the only oocyte to size
