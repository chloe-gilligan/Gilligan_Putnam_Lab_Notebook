## Work flow
- Using unity to open files (insert Danielle's protocol for installing unity)
- Once imageJ is open, select file and then open a .vsi file
- Each sample has two slides with two cross sections on each slide,
- During creating of staging guide, opening the first cross section and then moving to second if no gametes observed
	- Series 14 was the first opened and was opened at the maximum capacity in order to also get microns
- For the stage guide, corals were sized and characteristics were observed in order to assign a stage.
- When taking measurements, the diagonal diameter of oocytes was taken as they were usually and elongated oval shape.
	- For the final staging and sizing, the method of size measurements will be taken as a geometric mean



Count all
measure 3 max of each stage per each gamate 


grid was 10,000

grid not really needed if counting all but maybe for measurements

-how are measurements determined?
- not sure if measureming polyps or colonies 
- what to do if stage one eggs have not been determined 


slide 1 opened first and if it felt empty with no 5 polyps selected, went to slide two. series 14 was opened first and if there was nothing there the next series was opened.


5 good looking polyps per cross section

started towards the top left polyp and then moved through
