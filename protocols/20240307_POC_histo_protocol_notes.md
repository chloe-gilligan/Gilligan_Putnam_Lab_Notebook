## Work flow
- Using unity to open files (insert Danielle's protocol for installing unity)
- Once imageJ is open, select file and then open a .vsi file
- Each sample has two slides with two cross sections on each slide,
- During creating of staging guide, opening the first cross section and then moving to second if no gametes observed
	- Series 14 was the first opened and was opened at the maximum capacity in order to also get microns
- For the stage guide, corals were sized and characteristics were observed in order to assign a stage.
- When taking measurements, the diagonal diameter of oocytes was taken as they were usually and elongated oval shape.
	- For the final staging and sizing, the method of size measurements will be taken as a geometric mean
