# Equipment
- Macbook laptop (can be with any laptop but this protocol is specific to mac)
- Hard drive with histology slide images

# Protocol
1) Install ImageJ and Fiji, make sure java is preinstalled on computer
ImageJ:
**https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html**
Fiji:
**https://imagej.net/software/fiji/**

2) If using Olympus Image Processer, download OlympusViewer-mac-Ver2.3.1.dmg from website listed below

**https://imagej.net/formats/olympus**

Make sure that OlympusViewer-mac-Ver2.3.1.dmg is copied from download folder to plugin folder in imageJ and Fiji

3) Plug in hard drive

4) Open both ImageJ and Fiji

5) To open a file on either ImageJ or Fiji, select file then open and select the hard drive and open a .vsi file which should open a window asking about preferences. I just left everything as is and said OK.

6) When the .vsi file opens in ImageJ/Fiji that will bring you to a window of photos of your slide. To know what sample you are looking at select the lowest pixel image of your slide label.

This will normally be file labelled something like
 "Series 6:FLD_1-TP6.vsi #6: 251x 293; 3 planes"
 
 7) To get a close up of your slide, with the labelled still selected, scroll past the images with 3 copies and selecte the highest resolution image of your desired sample your computer can support. For me it is an image labelled "Series 14: 20 x BF 01: 16517 x 15756; 3 planes"
 
 8) With these both selected say OPEN. This may take a while depending on your computer.
 
 9) When both windows open adjust them acording to your screen so the sample and label are visable. 
 
 10) From here you can zoom and adjust to your image as you want but my preferences are to keep the hand option selected and then use + and - on my keyboard to zoom in and out to where my cursor is hovering over. 
 
 11) You can analyze the slides with circles, highlights, and measurements (that will be another protocol)
 
 12) To save any specific images you can screenshot the desired area as saving will not save you analyzed area.
