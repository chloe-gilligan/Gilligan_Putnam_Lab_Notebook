2. <a name="Protocol"></a> **Protocol**


	1. Remove coral fragment from dry shipper or freezer 
	2. Use forceps to place coral fragment in labeled ziplock bag (quart size)
	3. Airbrush with 1X PBS (pH = 7.4)  
		- Take care to remove tissue from entire surface area, including deep tissue
		- Attempt to keep total blastate volume below 50mL to fit into one falcon tube (i.e., use PBS through airbrush efficiently!). 
	4. Transfer tissue slurry from the bag to a sterile 50mL falcon tube and rinse sides of bag with 1x PBS, adding rinsate to falcon tube.
	5. Record total volume of tissue slurry and store on ice until homogenization
	6. Homogenize slurry for 30 sec on high in falcon tube using the [Bio-Gen PRO200 Homogenizer ](https://proscientific.com/hand-held-homogenizers/bio-gen-pro200-homogenizer/). If blastate is in multiple falcon tubes, homogenize each and pour back and forth between tubes to ensure even mixing.
	7. Between each sample, clean the forceps and the homogenizer in a 10% bleach solution for 30 seconds, DI wash #1 for 30 seconds, DI wash #2 for 30 seconds, then wipe down with an isopropanol wipe.

*****
*Store homogenized tissues in freezer or on ice until ready to aliquot for downstream assays*
*****

3. **downstream assays** 

	- Label four 1.5-mL microcentrifgue tubes for each sample. Chlorophyll, sym counts, holobiont protein, and host protein.
	- Add 1 mL homogenized tissue blastate to three of the 1.5-mL tubes. 
	    - One is Chlorophyll assay tube, one is symbiont density assay tube, and the last for holobiont protein/TAC/LPO assay tube. 
- Centrifuge the symbiont density tube at 13,000g for 3 min. 
	- From symbiont density tube, pipet off supernatant (~1mL) and place into host protein tube. *This is the host protein/TAC/LPO assay tube:*
	- To the symbiont pellet, add 1mL 1xPBS to resuspend pellet. Vortex thoroughly and pipet up and down to fully dissolve pellet. This is *the symbiont density assay tube:*
	- Freeze the remainder of the homogenate for Ash-free dry weight: 5 mL into a pre-burned aluminum drying pan (if ready to proceed straight away, otherwise falcon tube of homogenate can be stored at -40°C until ready). 
	
	- Immediately store all in the -40°C freezer until ready to proceed

<a name="Protocol"></a> **Protocol**

#### Creating the surface area standard curve of mass change of wax dipped dowels against geometrically calculated surface area. You want your standard curve to have an an R<sup>2</sup> value greater than 0.9.

1.  Make a table with the known dimensions of your wooden dowels to be used as standards:

      **colony_id**|**sample**|**diameter**|**weight1.g**|**weight2.g**|
      :-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
      Standard1	|Standard	|7.44
      Standard2	|Standard	|6.22
      Standard3	|Standard	|5.08
      Standard4	|Standard	|3.16
      Standard5	|Standard	|2.52
      Standard6	|Standard	|1.9
      Standard7	|Standard	|1.18

1.  Label wooden dowels with a sample number using a permanent marker if they are not labeled already.
1.  Turn on the Minerva Paraffin Wax Bath and set it to 65 °C ~5 hours before wax dipping.
1.  Take an initial weight of each wooden dowel using the analytical scale to the nearest 0.0001 grams.
1.  Using the small or large twizzers (depends on the size of the dowel), submerge the wooden dowel into the paraffin wax dipping bath for 2 seconds.
1. Remove the wooden dowel and rotate the sample quickly in the air in a circular motion for 10 revolutions.
1.  Repeat for each of the wooden dowels.
1.  Place wax dipped dowels on a sheet of aluminum foil.
1.  Allow the dowels to cool to room temperature before taking the final wax weight (~15-20 minutes).
1.  Once the wax dipped dowels have dried fully, take the final weight using the analytical scale to the nearest 0.0001 grams.
1.  Enter the initial and final weights into your spreadsheet.

#### The rest of this protocol is completed in the [surface area script](https://github.com/urol-e5/timeseries/blob/master/timepoint_1/scripts/surface_area.Rmd)

1.  Using the diameter (mm) of your wooden dowels, calculate the radius.
  - Radius (r) = diameter (D) / 2.
2.  Calculate the surface area of your wooden dowels using the surface area equation:
  - SA = 4πr<sup>2</sup>
3.  Plot the relationship of the surface area (cm<sup>2</sup>) on the x-axis to the weight of the wax (g) on the y-axis to check if your standard curve has an R<sup>2</sup> value greater than 0.9.
4. Using the plot, calculate the curve coefficients for the slope and the y-intercept to apply as the standard (this information will be used later to calculate the surface area for your samples).
  - y=mx+b
  - x=(y-b)/m
  - slope = 0.025
  - y-intercept = 0.0043

![Example Standard Curve](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/urol-e5/protocols/master/images/SA_StCurve.png)



#### Measuring coral surface area

1.  After following the airbrushing protocol on fresh or thawed corals, place coral skeletons on labeled aluminum foil in the drying oven at 60 °C for 4 h.
1.  Once the coral skeletons are dry (make sure there are no water droplets left), weigh the coral skeletons to the nearest 0.0001 grams.
1.  Using the tweezers, grab the base of the coral skeleton, if you can see where there was dead tissue, use this area to hold onto the skeleton.   
    - You want to make sure you are submerging all areas of the coral skeleton that had tissue cover.
1.   Once the wax is liquified (make sure there are no bubbles or solid pieces of wax left in the bath), fully submerge each coral skeleton into the bath for 2 seconds, remove the coral skeleton and rotate the sample quickly in the air in a circular motion for 10 revolutions.
1.  Place dipped coral skeletons onto labeled aluminum foil.
1.  Allow coral skeletons to dry to room temperature before taking the final weight.
1.  Once the dipped corals cool to room temperature, weigh each coral sample to the nearest 0.0001 grams.
1.  Make a table to calculate the surface area of your individual samples.

  **colony_id**|**sample**|**diameter**|**weight1.g**|**weight2.g**|
  :-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
  ACR-139	|Coral	|NA	|4.1315|	4.4772
9. Use the [surface area script](https://github.com/urol-e5/timeseries/blob/master/timepoint_1/scripts/surface_area.Rmd) to create an output file with your samples surface area values.

**Sample Preparation**  
1. Thaw homogenate aliquot.  
2. If not done already, centrifuge the 500 μL aliquot of adult airbrush homogenate at 13,000 rpm for 3 minutes to separate the host and Symbiodiniaceae cells.  
3. Remove and discard the supernatant.  
4. Add 1 mL of 100% acetone to the pellet in the 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and vortex the tubes for 15 sec.  
6. Add 1 ml of 100% acetone to a new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube to incubate with samples.
7. Place the tubes in a fridge in the dark at 4°C for 24 hours.  
8. Vortex the tubes for 15 sec.  
9. Spin the tubes down at 13,000 rpm for 3 minutes in the microcentrifuge to pellet any debris.  
10. Pipette 200µl of sample to duplicate wells of 96-well quartz plate.   
11. Pipette 200µl of acetone blank to duplicate wells and 200µl of incubated acetone blank to duplicate wells.   
12. Cover the plate with silicone pad every 5th sample or so to reduce evaporate as samples are added.  
13. Remove silicon pad.   
14. Follow steps below to measure the extract Absorbance on the [Synergy HTX Multi-Mode Microplate Reader](https://www.biotek.com/products/detection-multi-mode-microplate-readers/synergy-htx-multi-mode-reader/) at 630, 663, and 750 nm in a 96-well quartz plate.
15. Standardize for path length in 200µl of sample in 96-well quartz plate.

**Measure the Absorbance**  

Follow the [Synergy HTX Operating Manual](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/synergy_htx_manual.pdf) and [Gen5 Software Manual](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/Gen5_software_manual.pdf) to install the software on your host computer and general operating instructions.

1. Open the Gen5 software on your computer.

![software](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/urol-e5/protocols/master/images/GEN5_chloro.jpeg)


2. Whenever you start Gen5, the Task Manager opens. In Mo'orea, protocols (including chlorophyll) have been created on the Gen5 software on the HP Putnam Lab computer, so you can select the pre-made protocols from the dropdown menu.
3. To create a new protocol, follow the 'Getting Started' section in the [Gen5 Software Manual](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/Gen5_software_manual.pdf).
4. The plate loader should automatically open. Load your plate following the distinctions in the plate loader and you will be all set.
5. To measure Absorbance, select the 'Chlorophyll Protocol' option.

![task.manager](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/urol-e5/protocols/master/images/GEN5_software.jpeg)

6. Press the green start protocol button in the GEN5 software and allow the protocol to run through the 630, 663, and 750 nm.
7. Export the raw GEN5 software data file and a CSV to the Desktop in a designated folder. Also, immediately upload to a google drive folder to have for future use. 
8. Standardize for path length in 200µl of sample in 96-well quartz plate.


**Calculating Chlorophyll Concentration**  

Chlorophyll a and c2 concentrations are calculated from the equations in [Jeffrey and Humphrey 1975](https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0015379617307783?token=0937035D38C07F29ADF00F1F2A21F20F221219B1CC11A444A4F84D16B98EC3A6AD941D191BA2135A68C98BA62A0B69FE) after substracting A750nm from all measurements.  

![Equations for Dinos in 100% acetone](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/images/JH_EQ.png)

Need to correct for differences in path length of the volume in the 96 well plate compared to the 1cm path length of a cuvette.

**Adult Tissue Sample Preparation for Soluble Protein from Host**  
1. Thaw the 1000 μL aliquot of host only supernatant.   
2. Follow the aliquoting instructions in the e5 downstream analysis section of the [Airbrushing Protocol](https://github.com/urol-e5/protocols/blob/master/2020-01-01-Airbrushing.md)

**Preparation of Diluted Albumin (BSA) Standards**    
1. Dilute the contents of one Albumin Standard (BSA) ampule into several clean vials, preferably using the same diluent as the samples.
*These standards can be made during the 4 hour incubation period in the sample preparation section.*
2. Use the following table as a guide to prepare a set of protein standards. For this project we will use the microplate procedure. Diluent is DI water Type II. Each vial will be a sterile 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Label the cap of the microcentrifuge tube with the Vial ID ("A", "B", etc.).

**Preparation of the BCA Working Reagent (WR)**   
1. Use the following formula to determine the total volume of WR required:  
(# standards + # unknowns) x (# replicates) x (volume of WR per sample) = total volume WR required  
For this project, we will use 9 standards and 200 μL of WR is required for each sample in the microplate procedure.   
> *(9 standards + # samples) x (2 replicates) x (200 μL of WR) = total volume WR required*  
(9 standards + 10 samples) x (2 replicates) x (200 μL of WR) = 7,600 μL WR  
(9 standards + 20 samples) x (2 replicates) x (200 μL of WR) = 11,600 μL WR  
(9 standards + 40 samples) x (2 replicates) x (200 μL of WR) = 19,600 μL WR  

2. Prepare WR by mixing 50 parts of BCA Reagent A with 1 part of BCA Reagent B (50:1, Reagent A:B) in a clean protein-free container of the appropriate size, based on how many samples are going to be run.  

**Microplate Procedure (Sample to WR ratio = 1:8) from Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit:**  
1. Pipette 25 μL of each standard or unknown sample replicate into a microplate well (working range = 20–2000 μg/mL). (For example,Thermo ScientificTM PierceTM 96–Well Plates, Product No. 15041).
2. Add 200 μL of the WR to each well and mix plate thoroughly on a plate shaker for 30 seconds.
3. Cover plate and incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes.
4. Cool plate to RT. Measure the absorbance at or near 562 nm on a plate reader.
  - Wavelengths from 540–590 nm have been used successfully with this method.
5. Subtract the average 562 nm absorbance measurement of the Blank standard replicates from the 562 nm measurements of all other individual standard and unknown sample replicates.
6. Prepare a standard curve by plotting the average Blank–corrected 562 nm measurement for each BSA standard vs. its concentration in μg/mL. Use the standard curve to determine the protein concentration of each unknown sample.

                making sure to make a flattened bottom for the pan. Label with pencil, make sure to scrape it well but
                carefully, as they are more fragile than the pans.
    3.  After labeling, burn in the muffle furnace at 450°C for 4-6 h (some papers use 500°C for 4 or 6). 
    	    - Turn on muffle furnace
	    - Press both up and down arrows simultaneously to start run of  450°C for 4h.  
            - follow the [(Muffle Furnace Manual)](xxx) to reset the program to run at 450°C for 4-6 h. 
    4. 	After, remove from the muffle furnace, place in a glass desiccator and transport to the scale room.
	*Take care after this point that pans are not touched without gloves on, and that pans are ALWAYS sat on burned aluminum foil on tabletops and in ovens/furnaces/scales*
    5.  Record weight of burned pans on 4-decimal place scale (= “C” in Table 1.) Make sure you are using clean gloves or tweezers to weight the pans.
    6.  Keep pans in desiccator until used
    7. Remove frozen tissue homogenate from freezer and thaw.
    8. Vortex tissue homogenate and pipet 5 mL (use 5mL pipet) into a 15-mL falcon tube.
    9. Centrifuge the 15-mL tubes (in LTER lab) for 3 min. (0.03 on display) at 3500 min<sup>-1</sup>.
    10. Line cafeteria trays with aluminum foil and fill with empty pre-burned pans, using tweezers to transfer pans.
    11. After centrifuging 15-mL tubes, pipet 4 mL of supernatant (host fraction) into a pre-burned pan. Record the pan number used for each sample, and indicate in notebook that this is the host fraction for that sample.
    12. Discard the remaining <1 mL of supernatant, being careful not to lose the pellet.
    13. Resuspend the symbiont pellets in 15-mL tubes with 1 mL 1xPBS. Use 5-mL pipet to break up symbiont pellet and transfer **all** of the liquid into another pre-burned pan. Record pan number and sample ID in notebook, indicating that this is the symbiont fraction.
    14. Transfer trays of filled pans to drying oven at 80°C for at least 24 h. (If 80°C oven is not available, use 60°C drying oven).
    15. Weigh dried pans. Should be “at constant weight”. Preliminary steps may be needed to ensure samples have reached a constant weight. Leaving samples in drying oven longer than 24 h may be necessary, and is not detrimental.
    16.  After samples have reached a constant weight, weigh pan + dried samples on a 4- decimal scale and record weight (= “D” in Table 1.)
    17.  After recording the weight of the burned pan + dry tissue (and salts), place in the muffle furnace at 450°C for 4-6 h. 
	    - Turn on muffle furnace
	    - If Run light is on, press once to turn off
	    - Press Menu: screen should read 'NO PROG'
	    - Press Up arrow: screen should read 'YES PROG'
	    - Press Run. If blinking, press Run again. 
           - If for some reason the program has been erased, follow the [(Muffle Furnace Manual)](https://vdocuments.mx/isotemp-programmable-muffle-furnace-650-750-series-650-750-series-instruction-manual.html) to reset the program to run at 450°C for 4-6 h. 
Most literature uses a 6h burn period, but in preliminary tests of blastate 4h is sufficient to burn off the well dispersed (high SA of blastate in pans) residue. Oven also stays hot after turning off, so even at 4h (30 ramp up, 30 min ramp down + residual heat in oven…) the oven will be hot for some time.
	*NOTE: The organic fraction will burn off at 450°C leaving only salt and inorganics behind. The difference between the dry weight and burned weight is the organic fraction of biomass.*
    18.  Let pans cool and place in desiccator and transport to the scale. Avoid transporting when warm, it will cause water to adhere to pans.
    19.  Measure weight of burned pan + burned tissue (“D” – “F” in Table 1.). This is the AFDW of the organic fraction
    20.  The AFDW will be biomass (g) for each mL of tissue added, which will then be normalized by the total homogenate volume and skeletal surface area.

**Note: Coverslip is specially designed and weighted and no others can be substituted or the volume of the counting cell is not correct**   

- Clean hemacytometer and coverslip with DI water by squirting and wiping with a kimwipe. Place on microscope stand, turn on microscope, and visually inspect to make sure no cells are visible on grid. Each grid is divided into nine large squares- keep track of how many you count.
- Vortex sample to homogenize.   
- Use a glass pipet to mix the sample by pipetting up and down, then take a small amount and load one side of hemacytometer.
- With the coverslip on the chamber touch the chamber inlet groove place the tip of the pipette at 45° angle to the chamber. Gently release liquid from the pipette. The chamber should fill very quickly with liquid by capillary action, until the liquid front completely moves across the glass slide.  If the filling is slow, or if the liquid front is not even (e.g. when it forms a bubble) start over. 
- To fill the other side, Again, use a glass pipet to take a new mixed aliquot from sample tube as above and fill the other side. DO NOT fill both sides from same pipette fill.
- Using 10x or higher objective, count cells in one side of the hemacytometer. Each grid is divided into nine large squares- keep track of how many you count.
- Count the number of cells in whole squares until you reach at least 100 cells (or count all squares). 
	
**Note: counting should be standardized- compare your first run with someone else to ensure equivalent standards for what consitutes a cell vs. debris. For cells falling exactly on the border of two squares, cells on the left and bottom border should be considered inside of the square, while cells on the top and right border should be considered outside.**

- Repeat with other side of hemacytometer, counting the same number of squares as before and recording the cell count and number of squares.  
- Clean the hemacytometer and coverslip as before with DI water. Clean glass pipet with a tube of DI water.  
- Repeat above steps twice more for 6 total counts.   
   
**Note: Each count should count the same number of the nine large squares. For example, if the first count for sample X requires 3 squares to reach 100 squares, 3 squares should be counted on all subsequent counts for sample X.**

- Make sure average # of cells/square is consistent (calculate coefficient of variation of counts in a sample. It should be less than 10%).  
- Multiply # of cells/square by 10^4 and the dilution factor to get cells/mL.   
- Multiply by homogenate volume to get total cells.  
- Normalize to surface area to get cells/surface area.
